# The Exchanger – Project Submission README

## Project Overview

**The Exchanger** is a full‑stack MERN web application that allows users to list items, browse available listings, and exchange items with other users through trade offers. The application includes user authentication, image uploads, protected routes, and a single‑page application (SPA) frontend.

The frontend and backend are deployed **together as one application** and served from the same URL.

## Instructions to Run the Code Locally

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
* npm
* MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd the-exchanger
```

---

### Step 2: Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
node server.js
```

---

### Step 3: Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

The frontend build output will be generated in:

```
frontend/dist
```

This build is automatically served by the backend.

---

### Step 4: Access the Application

Open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

---

## Testing Information

* A `tests` folder exists **inside the frontend directory**
* The test files were **auto‑generated by Playerite**
* **There is no configured `npm test` script** in this project
* Tests were included for reference and grading purposes only

No backend test files were implemented.

---

## Deployment Details

* The application is deployed using **Google Cloud App Engine**
* Frontend and backend are bundled and deployed together
* Static frontend files are served via Express
* SPA routing is handled using a server‑side fallback to `index.html`

---

## Notes for Graders

* Frontend and backend URLs are intentionally the same
* All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api`
* Image uploads are served from `/api/uploads`
* Authentication routes are available under `/api/auth`
